# Chess API for Web Apps

Similar to the [Chess Server](https://github.com/chesslablab/chess-server), the [Chess API](https://github.com/chesslablab/chess-api) provides functionality to play chess online. Also it can be hosted on a custom domain. The main difference between both is that the Chess API endpoints may take few seconds to execute like a file download or a database query, while the Chess Server commands are intended to run faster.
